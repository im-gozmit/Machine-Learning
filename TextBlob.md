## TextBlob

First is the TextBlob library to play with string in Python : https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html

Penn Part-of-speech : https://cs.nyu.edu/grishman/jet/guide/PennPOS.html (using "tags" feature of textblob you can access the part-of-speech part)

Penn Part of Speech Tags
Note:  these are the 'modified' tags used for Penn tree banking; these are the tags used in the Jet system. NP, NPS, PP, and PP$ from the original Penn part-of-speech tagging were changed to NNP, NNPS, PRP, and PRP$ to avoid clashes with standard syntactic categories.
